## Our repositories

Digital Equity for Incarcerated Individuals (DE4II) is an undeveloped subfield of [digital equity](https://github.com/DE4II/advocacy-tools/wiki/Digital-Equity) focused on overcoming the [unique barriers](https://github.com/DE4II/advocacy-tools/wiki/Unique-Barriers) to advancing the [goals of digital equity](https://github.com/DE4II/advocacy-tools/wiki/Goals-of-Digital-Equity) in a [custodial context](https://github.com/DE4II/advocacy-tools/wiki/Custodial-Context).

As a nascent field, their exists no shared understanding about what digital equity means in a custodial context, no shared vocabulary for discussing DE4II issues, no tools or best practices for evaluating the lack of digital equity in a custodial context or for designing, developing, or implementing digital equity programs for incarcerated individuals, and no roadmap to guide or inform DE4II efforts.

### Advocacy Tools Repository

The DE4II [Advocacy Tools](https://github.com/DE4II/advocacy-tools) repository provides a place for [stakeholders](https://github.com/DE4II/advocacy-tools/wiki/Stakeholders) to discover, contribute to, and make use of DE4II tools and content designed to facilitate and promote DE4II efforts.

[Custodial Agencies](https://github.com/DE4II/advocacy-tools/wiki/Custodial-Agencies) only allow [incarcerated individuals](https://github.com/DE4II/advocacy-tools/wiki/Incarcerated-Individuals) access to [pre-approved](https://github.com/DE4II/advocacy-tools/wiki/Pre-Approval) [content](https://github.com/DE4II/advocacy-tools/wiki/CTS-Content), [apps](https://github.com/DE4II/advocacy-tools/wiki/CTS-Apps), and [services](https://github.com/DE4II/advocacy-tools/wiki/CTS-Services). Due to the onerous nature of the [pre-approval process](https://github.com/DE4II/advocacy-tools/wiki/CTS-Pre-Approval-Process), incarcerated individuals have access to only a small fraction of available [appropriate](https://github.com/DE4II/access-maps/wiki/Asset-Checklist) content and very few apps and services.

### Asset Maps Repository

The DE4II [Asset Maps](https://github.com/DE4II/asset-maps) repository provides a place for stakeholders to discover, contribute to, and make use of [curated](https://github.com/DE4II/asset-maps/wiki/Asset-Curation) lists of [reviewed](https://github.com/DE4II/asset-maps/wiki/Asset-Review) [assets](https://github.com/DE4II/asset-maps/wiki/Asset-Types) designed to accelerate and facilitate the pre-approval and delivery of assets to incarcerated individuals.
